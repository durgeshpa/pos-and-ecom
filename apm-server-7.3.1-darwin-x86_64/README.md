# Welcome to the Elastic APM Server 7.3.1

Elastic APM Server

## Getting Started

To get started with APM Server, you need to set up Elasticsearch on your
localhost first. After that, start APM Server with:

     ./apm-server -c apm-server.yml -e

This will start APM Server and send the data to your Elasticsearch instance. To
load the Elasticsearch template for APM Server into Kibana, run:

    ./apm-server setup -e
